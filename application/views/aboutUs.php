                Our founders are both teachers an endurance athletes.
                Both of them faced serious health challenges in their families. Running and cycling became a way
								to manage stress and live a more healthful lifestyle.
                <br>
                <br>
                After experiencing life changing results and finding motivation in movement,
                they sought ways to help others achieve their goals.
                <br>
                <br>
                Once they hit upon the concept of virtual racing, a dream was born.
